## Problem Ideas

- A travel path finding algorithm:

  - Transportation in downtown Tucson
  - Airport/Flight Scheduling
  - University Travel Planning

Project Proposal: People can get choice paralysis. What if there was a tool that
allowed the user to input their priorities such as travel time, cost, energy
efficiency, etc. This would relieve stress on the user's part by simplifying the
user's planning process.

### Project Implementation Details

- Creating an AND/OR tree to explore the options.
- Probability of making a flight given certain constraints (like a layover
  that's too short).
- Dynamic Path planning (in the case of missing a flight).
- Traffic Conditions initially hard coded for demonstration, can be populated
  with dynamic data later in the implementation.

## Assignment Procedures

1. Define the requirements for your system
2. Define the overall architecture of the system
3. Describe the component interactions and behaviors and how they work together
   to transport people.
4. Select two key concepts that have been discussed in class and apply them to a
   selective aspect.
5. Implement those two concepts in a simulation model to demonstrate the
   system's behavior.
6. Write a brief report.
